<strong>My Name Is Tiara!</strong>
<p><strong>I’m an artistic hippie trying to make a difference in society.</strong></p></head>
<p>I’ve always been the type to help people. I even thought about being a psychologist my freshman year of college. I just never could shake the creative gene in me. So I thought, “why not combine both?” Merge my love for helping people with my passion for art, and see what type of career I can have.</p>
<p>It’s everyone’s duty to advocate for the marginalized groups. Therefore, I love creating equality themed projects. These meaningful and rich messages revolve around topics such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Women’s rights</b>
    <li><b>Racial equality</b>
    <li><b>LGBTQ</b>
    <li><b>Self love</b>
</ul>
<p>There’s definitely no turning back! The content, the truths within the stories, are all real and relate to many individuals in the world. The work I’ve done and have been a part of includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Videos/short films</b>
    <li><b>Short essays</b>
    <li><b>Poetry</b>
    <li><b>Photography</b>
</ul>
<p>I hope you’re touched and enlightened while experiencing these works of art.</p>
